Browse Profile of Pets Available for Adoption:
Use Case Detailed Specification: A customer can browse through pet profiles 
and ,given his needs, 
set some filters that will allow him to browse for a more specific and a smaller or equal list of profiles that match to its filters. If the filters give an empty list,
the adopter is able to unset those filters or modify it.
Before being able to actually Browse for pets, the adopter(same as customer for this context) must complete the registration part which will let him have access
to the Pet Profiles, Applying for Adoption, Donation,etc. After the registration, the adopter is now able to look for pets. 
If they are no such pet that meet its needs, the web browsing page should display "No Results" and also display a UI that
will propose the adopter for some "Related Results". If there are no "Related Results" associated list then it should output
the most popular pets for adoption linked to highly rated owners. When browsing, the adopter is able to select by left-clicking the pet profile. If the adopter already has
posted for an adoption, he can still be able to browse.
