*********************************************************************************************SHELTER TESTING REPORT ***************************************************************************************
				The main testing concept used to test service methods inside the Pet_Service.java class related to SHELTER(methods related to Shelter) was Unit testing (white-box) where we
                                separately stress the methods we wrote to be sure that they give us the expected output and behavior with respect to our logic. We know that Shelter has a manager and also has
				a list of Pets that are in the architecture of the Shelter. Simple as that, the provided service methods must be sure that if there is a manager inside the Shelter, he should
				not be null when using the CreateShelter method. Also, when using CreateShelter method, if we are provided as input a List of Pets, this list can't be empty or contain null
				elements.


					As always, we verify that we CAN'T create a Shelter if there is already a Shelter in the Database with the same ID. This will throw an Exception 
						("Shelter with this ID already exists"). We used Try-Catch block to actually "try" to create a Shelter with the same ID , 
						we catch the exception and see if the error message correspond to the one we wrote in our service method. 
						This testing logic was used for all the methods inside Shelter, respectively :
				- CreateShelter(ID)
				- CreateShelter(ID, Manager, List of Pets)
				- updateShelter(Shelter)
				- getShelterByID(ID)
