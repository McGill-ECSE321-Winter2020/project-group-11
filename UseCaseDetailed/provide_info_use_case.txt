Description:

A potential user of the system hoping to adopt an animal (an adopter) is attempting to access the pet adoption system.
Before they may use the services, they must provide relavent information about themselves and their homes during a 
sign up process. This information may include, but is not limited to, their name, address, email, and phone number.
Only after this sign up information is received will the pet adoption system let them search through adoption postings.

4. A new account is made in the database for the account user
5. The user will have access to view adoption postings

Alternate Scenarios:

2a. The user does not follow the prompts towards the sign up process
3a. At least one of the values provided is not valid. 
    3a.1 Any of the values contain SQL code
    3a.2 The username is already taken
